To compile the code you will need GNU Make and gcc installed. 
you can execute the scripts in the script folder with bash installed too

Usage:
Clone the the repo, enter the directory cloned 
1. make
2. ./scripts/complexity (1st arg pile size 2nd number of test)
3. ./scripts/test.sh (1st number 2nd number)

I did not code those scripts.

Refer to the wiki session of this repo for my explanation of the code
